## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Favorite applications:
    1.) Linkedin: ability to create personalized URL and comment on other people's posts
    2.) Snapchat: camera filters and ability to share location, play games, and other activities
    3.) Instagram: connection with Meta Facebook and dark/light theme

App idea: Scouting app for FIRST Robotics teams - As a robotics coach, creating a platform for students to record other teams' OPR, robot capabilities, and max/min point average during each competition is a valid resource needed in the competitive robotics community. This app will include teams at each competition, include API info from Blue alliance as well as a form in which students fill out for each team for each match they play in and can filter the data needed accordingly for playoffs and alliance selection. It will be a search and entry database accessible to students and coaches in the competition world to help plan strategic game routines per match given the opposing alliance they are facing. 

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app: The only challenge I encountered was re-running the app after I moved the files into the github repo. folder. Otherwise, building the app was straightforward.
